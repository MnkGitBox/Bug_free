Helper &amp; bug fixed classes for my own projects

#### Request.swift
Please repplace your 'AlamofireDataBinding' library 'request.swift' file with this if you get `Generic type 'DataResponse' specialized with too few type parameters (got 1, but expected 2)` error. 
Usually this happen when you using **'Alamofire 5.0^'** version with **'AlamofireDataBinding 6.0'**.
